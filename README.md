Here are the some rules for other team members to contribute:

- Once you are finished with the development. Create a pull request to the 'raw-contributors' branch.
- For every Member there will be a selected section/page. And he will work on this selected section/page only.
- Every page must have the Global CSS & Reset CSS linked.
- Every section must follow this HTML layout:

```
<section>
  <div class="container">
    ...section content
  </div>
</section>
```

- Only use Global color variables for colors
- Use rem/em unites instead px

Further rules will be added here.

Happy Coding!
