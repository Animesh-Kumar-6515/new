- Everyone will start by forking this repo and after that go to the `contributors starter` branch and start coding there.
- Once you are finished with the development. Create a pull request to the `raw-contributors` branch.
- For every Member there will be a selected section/page. And he will work on this selected section/page only.
- Every page must have the Global CSS & Reset CSS linked.
- Every section must follow this HTML layout:
